# Python pre-final projects.

### Hello! here is my two projects that i've done.

In these projects, I was able to leverage my accumulated expertise in data analysis using Python libraries. I successfully applied a comprehensive range of data analysis techniques and methodologies, facilitated by Python's libraries, to deliver robust and insightful solutions. The utilization of these libraries enabled me to effectively manipulate, visualize, and derive meaningful insights from complex datasets, underscoring my proficiency in leveraging technological tools to extract valuable information. This achievement underscores my commitment to delivering data-driven solutions and highlights my ability to employ cutting-edge technologies to solve intricate analytical challenges. 

## Project 1 - e-commerce - [pre-final project 1](https://github.com/oy-repin/projects/blob/main/project_1%20(1).ipynb)
## Project 2 - e-learning - [pre-final project 2](https://github.com/oy-repin/projects/blob/main/project_2%20(1).ipynb)

The tasks of the pre-final project include:

1. Extracting and studying the existing data: Understanding the column descriptions and comprehending the structure of the data, as well as identifying relationships between different data points.

2. Independently making decisions regarding the interpretation of ambiguous aspects within the data.

3. Performing data operations within the project's scope: Carrying out data manipulations and transformations as outlined in the project's requirements.

4. Providing well-reasoned justifications for your actions: Describing the rationale behind your decisions and calculations. This involves explaining the basis for determining key data points such as purchases, churn, and defining terms like undelivered goods.

5. Investigating the data for anomalies: Identifying and addressing any anomalies or outliers present in the dataset.

6. Drawing conclusions from the tasks performed: Summarizing the outcomes of your analyses and any insights gained, if deemed necessary.

7. Engaging in Git practices: Demonstrating proficiency in using Git for version control, collaboration, and tracking changes in your project.

8. Optionally, showcasing creativity in the project: Incorporating creative elements such as graphical visualizations, tables, or other innovative approaches to present the findings and insights derived from the data.

**These tasks collectively contribute to a comprehensive data analysis project, where I navigate through data intricacies, make informed decisions, and present meaningful insights.
